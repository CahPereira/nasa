# ASTROSAT!

Objective: Farmers face a deluge of water-related challenges due to unpredictable weather, pests, and diseases. These factors can significantly impact crop health, farmers’ profits, and food security. Depending upon the geography, many farmers may face droughts or floods—sometimes both of these extreme events occur within the same season! Your challenge is to design a tool that empowers farmers to easily explore, analyze, and utilize NASA datasets to address these water-related concerns and improve their farming practices.


High Level Project Summary: We offer a dynamic, user-friendly web platform designed to provide farmers access to critical data essential for enhancing agricultural productivity. Our platform empowers farmers to make smart decisions regarding planting, irrigation, pest control, and harvesting. While NASA already provides valuable information that can assist farmers in addressing challenges, our goal is to make this data more accessible to farmers of diverse backgrounds. We achieve this through a visually intuitive website, simplifying complex datasets into a clear and effective format, allowing farmers to use these insights with ease and confidence. The information is tailored to each farm's specific location, providing detailed data on temperature, crop yield, soil and plant evaporation, vegetation, and more. This is achieved by leveraging NASA datasets and advanced tools such as FireBase. By delivering precise, location-based insights, our platform helps farmers optimize their strategies and respond effectively to local conditions, such as potential droughts, and flooding, among others.


Low Level Project Summary: The website consists of five distinct pages, each crafted to enhance the user experience. Key features derived from the NASA dataset include crop yield, soil and plant evaporation, temperature, and vegetation. Upon accessing the platform, farmers are prompted to enter their location via an initial form. This input leads to a new page that displays location-specific data, such as temperature, vegetation, soil evaporation, and crop yield. In addition to real-time information, farmers can access historical data relevant to their location. By providing those insights from the NASA database, the platform offers practical and dynamic solutions to the food security challenges farmers face, which leads to financial benefits and improved food security. Moreover, the website allows for comparisons between different counties, further assisting farmers in their decision-making. Looking ahead, a future goal is to develop a predictive model that offers deeper insights and expand the website's data to support farmers in other countries, particularly those facing environmental and economic challenges. The website was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, with the webpage design entirely coded by the front-end team.
